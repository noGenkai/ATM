Term Project
CEN 4010


Analyze and design a software system to control an Automatic Teller Machine (ATM) for DSC Bank of Daytona Beach, Florida. DSC bank provides checking accounts, saving accounts, loan services and credit card services to its’ customers.

Customers can gain information and make transactions using this ATM by inserting their banking card and supplying their Personal Identification Number (PIN).

Assume the following:

•	Multiple accounts under one customer name are possible. This includes the customer who has one of each different type of account as well as the customer with several of one type of account.
•	Each account has a unique account number but there is only one PIN per customer. All of any one individual’s accounts will be accessed using this one PIN.
•	The ATM is a menu driven system which displays menus and information on a CRT and accepts input through an ASCII keyboard.


The following minimum functionality should be included in your system. Any additional features that will enhance the systems capabilities and/or efficiency should also be included:

•	A customer should be able to gain balance information on each type of account he/she has with DSCB bank (checking, savings, loan, mortgage, car or boat loan account and credit card account).
•	Customers should be allowed to deposit funds to any account and make cash withdrawals from either a checking or savings account. 
•	Customers should be able to make cash advanced withdrawals from their credit card providing they have sufficient credit. 
•	Customers should be able to make Mortgage payment.
•	Customers should be able to make car loan payment.
•	Customers should be able to transfer funds between any two accounts.
•	Limits should be placed on the amount of money that can be withdrawn from an account ($500.00) as well as on the number of transactions allowed per day (10). There is no limit on the amount that can be transferred between accounts. 


Design, and test the system using the Structured Analysis and Design Software Development Methodology. You should follow the report format document that is posted on DSC Falcon online (D2L). Report should include all items pertaining to analysis and design (Introduction, Context Diagram, DFD, DD, Process specification, structure chart, and module specification, coding, testing, and conclusion). These elements should be created using VISIO software (or any similar software) and all reports should be typed and properly formatted (i.e., no page break in the middle of paragraphs, proper indention and margins, etc.). 

This is a group project even though you have the option of completing it all by yourself. 
Maximum size of a group is 3 students. Each group must elect one person as group leader. Every group leader must send me an e-mail (bahman.motlagh@daytonastate.edu ) and let me know the names of every group member. You cannot add a new member to a group once it is formed. At the end of semester each group leader submits only one copy of project with the name of all members on cover page. 

Due date: May 5, 2021 (midnight).
